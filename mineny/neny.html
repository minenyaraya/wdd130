      <h2>
          This is a website for co-workers, families, or individuals.
        Being unique makes us different.
        Being different can make us go out of tune.
         
        We want to emphasize good communication and find harmony in it. 
        We have 3 topics
        Learn 
        Share
        Understand
        
        1 learn
        One of the human abilities is learning, from babbling to speaking, 
        from crawling to walking. Because they are natural facts, 
        we forget to see that everything we learn is an achievement, 
        a miracle, a consequence of having perseverance, it is an act of faith, 
        it is having the courage to do it, having the will, it is the right thing to do. 
        A good use of time, is to make the most of life's opportunities.
        Now, what is learning?
        Let's see what the dictionary says:
         
        1- To learn: to gain or acquire knowledge 
        or skill in (something) through study, experience, or teaching.
         
        The word learn comes from the Latin
        • Ap- which means close to and –prehendere, to capture.
        What it means is that we are close to capturing something, 
        the list of what we can capture is long, so my first word 
        is “learn”.
        What do we communicate to the user when he opens a page?
         
        We must think of the first word, learn, the goal is 
        that the user feels that he learns something new by 
        seeing it from another point of view.
        
        
        2 Share:
        According to the dictionary:
        A part or portion of a larger amount that is divided 
        among a number of people, or contributed to by a number of people.
        In Spanish it is a little different, give part of what you have 
        so that someone else can enjoy it with you.
        What is sharing in psychology?
        Sharing is a prosocial behavior and is the joint use of a resource or space
        I love the definition in Spanish, a part or portion of what she has so 
        that another can enjoy it with her.
        That is my second goal.
        Share my talents for people to enjoy with each other.
        3- Understand: according to the dictionary:
        To Perceive and have a clear idea of what is said, done, or happened or 
        discover the deep meaning of something.
        To perceive the intended meaning of (words, language, or a speaker).
        In psychology: it is the process of obtaining information about oneself 
        or others or of understanding the meaning or importance of something, 
        such as a word, a concept, an argument, or an event.
        I want to reach people in a clear way so that they can clearly understand 
        the messages of the pages, that they are a means of learning, a place where 
        sharing is fun, and people can interact to understand each other.
